## Actodo Project

## Project Description
Actodo is a simple and intuitive task management application built with React. It allows users to create, view, edit, and manage their to-do tasks. The app is built using React Router for navigation between different views, and it demonstrates the use of React components for creating reusable UI elements. Users can filter tasks based on their completion status, and the application provides an easy way to organize and track daily tasks.

## Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
Edit Tasks: Tasks can be modified or updated easily.
Mark as Complete: Tasks can be marked as complete when finished.
Delete Tasks: Tasks can be removed from the list.
Filter Tasks: Filter tasks by status â€” view all tasks, completed tasks, or pending tasks.
Persistent Data: Optional feature to store tasks in local storage, so tasks are saved across browser sessions.
Responsive Design: The UI is fully responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.

## Tech Stack
React: For building the user interface.
React Router: For managing routes and navigation between different task views.
CSS: For styling the components.
Local Storage: (Optional) For persisting tasks across browser sessions.
